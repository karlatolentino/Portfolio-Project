                            Hi! I'm Karla. I am an aspiring <strong>Web Developer</strong> studying at <strong>Coder Academy</strong> in Melbourne, Australia.
                            <br>
                            <br>One of my passions include photography. I am a <strong>self taught photographer</strong> and have photographed live music events to showcase for a music review website. 
                            <br>
                            <br>The backdrops of my website have been taken by myself when I was out exploring the world! I'm a big fan of the outdoors and love going out and socialising in the many cafes and restaurants in Melbourne, Australia.
                            <br>
                        </p>

                <!-- Skills & Experience container component -->
                <div class="skills-container animate__animated animate__backInRight">
                        <h1 class="skills-header">Skills & Experience</h1>
                        <div class="skills-contents">
                        <p>
                            I have always been fascinated by technology; new and old. At a very young age I discovered the world of computers, video games and the internet. This has lead me to explore my interest in technology!
                            <br>
                            <br>I am in the process of transitioning into a career in tech. I am learning how to code beautiful and functional web pages to add to my portfolio and showcase them for potential employers.
                            <br>
                            <br> I have worked in team leader roles in the hospitality industry and am currently working as a <strong>Barber</strong> in a high-end barbershop where I communicate closely with clients to achieve their desired look. 
                            <br>
                            <br>I believe my background in barbering and photography will give me the <strong>high attention to detail</strong> and <strong>strong communication skills</strong> that are needed to be a successful Junior Dev!
                            <br>
